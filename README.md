# hackathon-server

Simple node server to serve json data. 


###Install node modules:
```sh
$ npm install
```
###Start the server:
```sh
$ npm start
```

###Data is served at: 
[http://localhost:1337/locations](http://localhost:1337/locations).

If you don't want to use a local server, you can access the data directly with this link:

## Possible Use Cases

- Display the data in a simple table (e.g. with hotel name & address)
- Add a text field to filter the table
- Click on a row to open a detailed view
- Add a form where you can enter the number of people to calculate the total price
- Add a button which generates an email text which you would send to the hotel's contact person to request a booking (number of people, date, number of nights)
